# ship.sh - cut a release. GITHUB BUILDS AND SIGNS IT; this prepares and queues that.
#
#   bash ship.sh "what changed this release"          # the normal path: gate, push, then Claude dispatches android.yml
#   bash ship.sh --local "what changed"               # FALLBACK ONLY: build it here instead (Actions down / out of minutes)
#
# WHY GITHUB BUILDS IT
# --------------------
# The owner's rule on all his repos: "GitHub Actions should do all the app compiling and apk making. Claude codes the app,
# GitHub makes the apk." The mechanism:
#   1. Claude codes, tests and checkpoints as usual (tools/ckpt.sh).
#   2. `ship.sh "note"` runs the cheap local gates first - a red suite must never spend GitHub's minutes - then pushes.
#   3. Claude dispatches .github/workflows/android.yml through the GitHub API (mcp__github__actions_run_trigger). That run
#      builds, SIGNS, verifies the certificate on the artifact it just produced, and publishes a GitHub Release with the APK.
#   4. Once that run is green, tools/record-release.sh writes the line into BUILDLOG.md.
# The APK is never committed: Releases hold the binaries, BUILDLOG.md is the durable record (and what the next versionCode is gated on).
