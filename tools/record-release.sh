# record-release.sh - write a shipped version into BUILDLOG.md, AFTER GitHub built it.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE STEP FROM ship.sh
# ----------------------------------------
# BUILDLOG.md is load-bearing, not documentation: it is the durable record of every versionCode that was ever shipped, and
# BOTH ship.sh and .github/workflows/android.yml read it to decide whether the next build could actually install over the
# last one on the tablet. A line in it is a claim that a release EXISTS.
#
# ship.sh does not build the APK - GitHub does - so when ship.sh finishes the release does not exist yet. Writing the line
# there would make BUILDLOG lie whenever the run failed. So: ship.sh gates and pushes, GitHub builds, and only once that run is
# GREEN (and the Release shows its APK) does this record it.
