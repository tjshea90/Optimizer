# push.sh — get commits to GitHub, and never decide "no" by accident.
#
# Called by autosave.sh (after every tool call), ckpt.sh and ship.sh. Rule: when
# "is there anything to push?" cannot be PROVEN to be no, push. A wasted push costs a
# second; a skipped one costs the session (the container is destroyed when it ends).
# `@{u}` is not trusted for this: a branch made from FETCH_HEAD has no remote-tracking
# ref, `@{u}` errors, and the old `|| echo 0` fallback read that as "nothing to push".
#
# main: tools/MIRROR_MAIN decides whether every successful push also fast-forwards
# origin/main (plain push, never forced, so it can only fast-forward). It is committed
# so every account sees the same setting. Default "off": the sessions are told which
# branch to develop on, so landing on main is the owner's call (see CLAUDE.md "Branches").
